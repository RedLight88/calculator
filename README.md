# calculator

Used for the first time grid, played around more with flex. Forgot to add the number 0...
Maybe the script could've been made easier but this is my first thought, if it works it works.
Had to search up a lot about stacks and how they're used in calculators.
Understood that eval() is a security risk so decided not to use it.
I've challanged myself to only use DOM methods for this one.
